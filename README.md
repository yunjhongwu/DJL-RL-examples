DJL-RL
======
Examples of reinforcement learning implementations with [DJL](https://djl.ai/) (tested with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) backend). This repository aims to provide toy examples of RL models in Java. 

 - Models:
   - DQN
   - Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
   - Quantile Regression DQN

DynaQ, which does not rely on DJL, is also provided for debug and benchmark purpose.
   
The repository also includes two easy [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) tasks to help users debug. 

 - Gym environments:
   - CartPole
   - MountainCar
